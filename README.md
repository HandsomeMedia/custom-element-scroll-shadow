# Custom Element: Content Scroll Shadow
Creates visual separation between fixed header and content upon scroll

### Demo
https://handsomemedia.github.io/custom-element-scroll-shadow/dist

### Notes
- uses _Web Components_: Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and Template
- self-contained HTML, CSS, and JS 
- uses native Intersection Observer API - more performant than listening to scroll event
- Custom Elements and Shadow DOM currently need polyfill Firefox and Edge (not implemented here)
- Intersection Observer currently requires polyfill for Safari
