# Custom Element: Content Scroll Shadow, allowing visual separation of fixed header

### Demo
https://handsomemedia.github.io/custom-element-scroll-shadow/dist

### Notes
- uses Web Components: Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and Template
- self-contained HTML, CSS, and JS 
- uses native Intersection Observer API which is more performant than listening to scroll event
- HTML Template is well supported by all browsers
- Custom Elements and Shadow DOM currently need polyfill Firefox and Edge (not implemented here)
- Intersection Observer currently requires polyfill for Safari (not implemented here)
